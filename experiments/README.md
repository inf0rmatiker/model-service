# Experiments

- RQ-1 How can we scale training/validating of geospatial models?
  - Train models in reasonable amount of time
- RQ-2 How can we parameterize the configuration of the model?
  - Parameterizing models allows for users to specify predefined hyperparameters which saves time
- RQ-3 How can we efficiently store and retrieve trained models?
- RQ-4 How do models trained locally compare to a globally-trained model?

## RQ-1

Compare time of global model to time of all local models.


## RQ-2



## RQ-3


## RQ-4
