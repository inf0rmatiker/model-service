# Experiments

- RQ-1 How can we scale training/validating of geospatial models?
  - Train models in reasonable amount of time
- RQ-2 How can we parameterize the configuration of the model?
  - Parameterizing models allows for users to specify predefined hyperparameters which saves time


## RQ-1

Compare time of global model to time of all local models.
Compare time of CPU-trained/validated models to time of GPU-trained/validated models.
